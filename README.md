# Mindful Melody VR

For more info about the project, check out [the Devpost page](https://devpost.com/software/quest-piano)!

## What it does
In the VR scene, a digital piano is mapped on top of the physical one (tracked via Quest controller). You can then play the instrument physically and see it animate in the digital world, with the world changing based on what's being played. Try different melodies and combinations of notes to see what happens!

## How to use
You will need a computer with Unity installed, connected to a Meta Quest 2 and a piano keyboard for MIDI input. Set up the left controller at the right end of the keyboard as shown in the photo. Download all the files and run it in Unity to experience Mindful Melody VR.
